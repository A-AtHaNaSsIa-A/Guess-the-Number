# Guess the Number
Once you start the game: -> Click on Easy, Medium or Hard, based on the difficulty level you want to play the game in, -> Once you've chosen and selected your difficulty level, click on the button Randomize to let the game load a number which depends on the difficulty level you chose, -> Start by writing your guessings in the entry under the short description in the game. Hope you like it! <3 (made with PYTHON)
